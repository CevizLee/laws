## Temporary Terms and Conditions for Liberland Registration and Maintenance of Companies

### Preface

These are temporary Terms and Conditions to our services regarding the setting up, the registration, the business life and the termination of companies in Liberland, understood in the broadest possible sense. The purpose of this document is to prevent misunderstandings and to manage certain expectations which we at present might not be able to fully satisfy, regarding a number of functions and consequences which are usually understood as a part of company registration in extant states.

These Terms and Conditions are temporary and shall be valid only until such a time as Liberland gains, in form or in fact, the recognition of a significant part of the community of nations which will in fact enable it to resume the regular duties one might expect of states.

Rest assured that we are doing all that is in our power to hasten the day on which this document will be delegated to the archives of history.

**Art. 1**

**The General Provision**

**Art. 2**

**Limitations on Enforcement**

§3

1) Liberland is in her present state unable to enforce law to the extent to which most States are able to enforce it; this regards and is not limited to

a) the enforcement of Liberland&#39;s judicial decisions;

b) the maintenance of order in Liberland&#39;s territory;

**Art. 3**

**Lack of Recognition of Companies**

§4

1) As a State with limited international recognition at present, Liberland has no power to demand and little chance to procure otherwise the guarantee of other States that they should fully recognize Companies registered in Liberland as Companies according to their law, and that in the way you intended your company to be recognized and acknowledged by them.

2) You therefore understand that your Company may be:

a) wholly unrecognized and considered null and void in the law of another State or in the international law and business community;

b) only partially recognized and that in a different way than how you intended it, in full or in part; your corporate structure might likewise be misrepresented or outright changed by actions of State or another authority as a consequence of your registration in Liberland;

c) considered less reputable as a result of its registration in Liberland;

d) in any other way misrepresented, misunderstood or it or its owners and operations in any way whatsoever damaged by any Party, be they public or private, as a consequence of your registration in Liberland.

a) States;

b) other subjects public or private; and

c) the international community or the international business community;

even should this be to your detriment or to that of your company.

**Art. 4**

**Matters of Taxation, Double Taxation**

§5

1) Protection from double taxation is based on a reciprocal recognition of two States of each other as legitimate sovereigns in power over their territories and as equals. Reciprocity for the broader purposes regarding taxes is likewise reserved for already established and recognized States.

2) Without such recognition, Liberland cannot guarantee in any way whatsoever any protection from tax authorities, double taxation or any taxation-related enforcement, judgement, action or consequence in the broadest possible sense, and that with respect to both natural Persons and to Companies, even where such a protection would be naturally expected of a State where one registers their company.

3) You agree to waive any responsibility of Liberland for any tax-related consequence to yourself, your Company, its Shareholders, its employees, its business relations, etc., even should this be to your detriment or that of your Company.

§6

1) You agree here that you understand in advance in full the consequences of establishing your company in an internationally unrecognized State, such as Liberland, and in Liberland herself, and you waive any possible claims stemming from a lack of understanding of the situation regarding taxes and related subjects of a Company in Liberland, including any and all consequences.

2) You therefore waive in advance any claims regarding misdirection, subterfuge, withholding information, etc. on the part of Liberland with respect to these matters.

**Art. 5**

**Vis Maior, Vis Minor**

§6

1) You waive any and all claims which you would now or in future be liable to make against Liberland for not fulfilling any or all her obligations to you, your Company or any other subject, stemming from any occurrences which in law are termed _force majeure_, or circumstances normally not under human control.

2) This includes and is not limited to the natural forces, disasters natural or otherwise and other calamities and occurrences which Liberland cannot prevent or stop or only at a great difficulty, and also to the forces of the Market.

§7

You furthermore waive any and all claims which you would now or in future be liable to make against Liberland where she should be unable to fulfill any or all her obligations to you, your Company or any other subjects, consequent of actions of another State acting in a way which Liberland is not able to prevent, or actions of the international community, an international organization or any other Person or Institution, public or private.

2) The above notwithstanding, Liberland is not a tax haven nor an offshore destination nor is to be designated or understood in any similar terms. You therefore agree and confirm that your express purpose to come to Liberland is not to

a) evade or avoid taxation for your Company, yourself, or for any other subject;

b) launder money, finance crime or terrorism or prosper from such financing;

c) siphon capital from another Country;

d) set up the structure of your Company to purposefully profit from Liberland as if she was a tax haven; and/or

e) use your assets in a way to circumvent taxation;

nor any other similar reasons, but to freely take part in this burgeoning new way of life that Liberland seeks to offer you. You may partake in Liberland&#39;s favorable tax system, of course, but you understand that to be merely a necessary consequence of Liberland&#39;s free nature, and not the purpose of the setting up of our new State.

§9

You agree that you do not expect nor will you ever expect Liberland to provide services or an environment which one might expect to find in a tax haven or a similar such destination, understood as broadly as possible. You waive any possible claim you or your Company could make against Liberland should such expectations prove to be unfulfilled in any way, including their consequences.

**Art. 7**

1) You understand and agree that Liberland seeks to uphold responsibility and transparency in order to secure her place in the international community as a well respected State.

2) You will therefore not object to data collection for the purposes of customer due diligence, prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism or any other such end as defined by the international community, on Liberland&#39;s part, where such data collection is reasonable according to internationally understood best practices in customer dilligence.

3) You agree that Liberland may collect and retain your personal or company data for the purposes as denoted in this paragraph or for the purpose of enabling her to service you the way as agreed by your mutual contract.

Liberland, her Agents, her Public Administration, her President or any other Persons working on her behalf pledge to you, our valued partner, that we are and will be doing what can be reasonably expected of us to secure the speedy and broad recognition of Liberland by the international community, so that these Terms and Conditions should in future no longer be necessary, at least not in their present form.
